# Internal-Tempo
An application for musicians to help improve their internal sense of time by providing custom exercises based around a sparse metronome click
It is currently still in progress

# Information
The functionality for the metronome is all built into the Javascript for the webpage. Django is merely the host for the page.
I'm planning to create more helpful apps for musicians and integrate them all into this Django project
